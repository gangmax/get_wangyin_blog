# 我在国际空间站视频里写的评论

From [here](https://yinwang1.substack.com/p/a10).

<span>昨天，我在之前提到的“</span>[国际空间站参观视频](https://youtu.be/SGP6Y0Pnhe4)<span>”里写了一条评论，指出从窗口看出去一颗星星也没有。不出所料，今天就有人回复我，说那是因为相机在有很亮物体的情况下会自动调节曝光，所以就照不到星星了。这种说法我已经看了不知多少遍。</span>

由于这个说法如此的幼稚，很多人从未亲自做过实验就盲目相信别人的话，所以我给他写了一段英文的回复，全文如下：

That's not true and their usual excuse. Bright object only turns the camera exposure down if you use auto mode. If the exposure is so low that the photo can't show the stars, the details of normal objects (except very bright object) will be all gone, and the photo will be mostly black and unusable. This is because the stars are brighter than the dark/gray area of normal objects. If stars are gone, so are the objects' details. You can experiment with this by manually turning the exposure down and see. You can do that even with your phone. But that's not the case for space photos. Space photos have objects' details, but no stars. This violates the experience of photography.

More over, in the ISS they have all those advanced cameras, lens and shields (as shown at 20:52). They can just block the bright objects out of view. They can shoot in directions that there are no bright objects in view (just as in this cupola scene). They can just point directly (and only) to the dark skies and take starry photos. But they never took even one photo with stars and the Milky Way. After so many years of so many space projects, not even one photo shows the magnificent starry skies we should be able to see in a vaccum space. We have so many magnificent starry night photos taken on earth's mountains, but none from space.

Remember, the universe is filled with billions of stars. They are everywhere. They are shining. There is no air or clouds in space to block their light. There is no excuse for not having even one space photo showing them.
