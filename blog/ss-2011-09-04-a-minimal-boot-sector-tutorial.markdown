The natural first step of building an operating system is to find a way to run programs on "bare hardware". The task turns out to be quite easy despite its daunting first impression. After researching on the net and trying out various tutorials, I foundÂ all of them overly complicated. Most of them assume interfacing with a C-like language and implementing a Unix-like system, but C and Unix are not the only story about operating systems design. A boot sector tutorial should teach nothing more than how to boot a computer.

After learning the good parts from the tutorials and applying my own simplifications, I arrived at my first boot sector. It is very simple and does very little -- it just boots the machine and displays a colorful banner -- but it illustrates the only things you need to know for booting a computer.

The code is very short -- only 21 lines of code excluding comments and blank lines.

<span>It is in</span> [NASM](http://www.nasm.us) <span>syntax and needs nasm to be assembled into machine code. After that it can be booted by</span> [QEMU](http://www.qemu.org)<span>, a processor emulator. The only two necessary command lines are (assuming the code is stored in a file named myfirst.asm):</span>

> nasm -f bin -o myfirst.bin myfirst.asm
>     qemu -hda myfirst.bin

Of course, you can also burn the disk image (myfirst.bin) onto a CD and boot a real machine from it.
