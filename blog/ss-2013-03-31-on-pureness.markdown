#On pureness

From [here](https://yinwang1.substack.com/p/purely-functional).

<span>It is usually a pleasure to use a functional programming language, but it is doubtful whether we should care about the "pureness" of the language. To write programs in a completely </span>_pure_<span>functional programming language (e.g. Haskell) is much like living in a</span> _wired world_<span>.</span>

There are no electromagnetic waves nor sound waves in such a world, so you don't have wifi, cell phones, satellite televisions, radios, etc. You don't even have light or sound. In other words, everything is blind and deaf.

All information must pass through wires or pipes, connected by switch boxes which we call "monads". You must carefully route all the wires and pipes and connect them correctly before any information processing device, including your eyes and ears, can properly work.

<span>So I think a language will need parts of it not to be pure, in order to naturally represent the effects such as electromagnetic waves. Normally those effects are called "</span>[benign effects](http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/05/01/of-course-ml-has-monads)<span>".</span>
