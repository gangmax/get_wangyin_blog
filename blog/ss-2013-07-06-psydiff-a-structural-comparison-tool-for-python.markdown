If interested, you can see a demo of it here (psydiff comparing itself):</span> [http://www.yinwang.org/resources/pydiff1-pydiff2.html](http://www.yinwang.org/resources/pydiff1-pydiff2.html) <span>All the source code can be downloaded from my GitHub repo:</span> [http://github.com/yinwang0/psydiff](https://github.com/yinwang0/psydiff) <span>It's still in early stage of development. I appreciate your bug reports, feature requests or contributions.</span>
